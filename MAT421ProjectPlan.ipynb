In summary, interpolation assumes that there is no error found in the dataset, including every point in the final function, while regression assumes some level of noise, minimizing the error in order to make more accurate predictions. Understanding these strengths and weaknesses of the two methods will help to better analyze the differences in accuracy.\n",

This is because of the way global temperature functions mathematically. Since temperature in a place is continuous, it can more easily be mapped to a single function. I also predict that as the gaps in data increases, the accuracy of both methods will decrease, since less data is being used to make accurate predictions."
